# üß† MCI Prediction and SHAP-based Explanation Dashboard

This project provides a web-based tool for predicting Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) risk using a Random Forest classifier trained on physical and laboratory indicators. The interface also presents an explanation for each prediction using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) force plots.

---

## üìå Project Objectives

- Predict individual MCI risk using clinically interpretable features.
- Enable visual explanation of predictions via SHAP force plots.
- Provide a reproducible, deployable, and user-friendly web app.

## üñ•Ô∏è Web App Overview

The Streamlit interface allows users to:
- Input patient features such as education, grip strength, and blood indicators.
- Get a binary prediction of MCI risk (high/low).
- View a SHAP-based force plot explaining feature contributions.
